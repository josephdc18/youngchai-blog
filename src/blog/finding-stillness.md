Sometimes the loudest thing in the room is the constant buzz of my own thoughts. I spent a full weekend without my phone, just tea, a notebook, and the slow hum of the radiator. By day two, I could finally hear myself breathe.

I wrote down what I noticed: the way sunlight lands differently at 8:17am, how the kettle whistles in three stages, and how stillness isn't the absence of activity—it is choosing where to place your attention. This is a love letter to the quiet corners of our days.

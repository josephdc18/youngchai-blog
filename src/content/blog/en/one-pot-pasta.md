My favorite dinner trick: simmer the pasta in just enough broth so the starches thicken the sauce naturally. Stir in lemon zest, a fistful of torn kale, and the last spoonful of ricotta hiding in the fridge. Dinner, done.

This recipe was born on a Tuesday when the grocery list was ignored and the inbox was loud. It's proof that comfort can be simple and still feel celebratory.

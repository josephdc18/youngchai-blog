The office is really just a 6x8 foot sunroom, but it holds my entire creative life. I shared the layout, the storage solutions that actually work, and the ritual of lighting a candle before opening my laptop.

Small spaces demand intention—every object has to earn its keep. This room makes me want to sit down and write.

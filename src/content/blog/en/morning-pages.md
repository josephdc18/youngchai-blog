Julia Cameron was onto something. Writing three stream-of-consciousness pages every morning cleared space in my mind. Some days it's poetic, most days it's a to-do list in disguise, but all of it is honest.

I tracked what changed: less rumination, more focused coding sessions, and a steady drip of creative ideas that feel grounded in real life.

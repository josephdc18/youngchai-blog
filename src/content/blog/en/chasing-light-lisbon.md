\## The CR Smith Museum was a hit with the boys. It’s a solid 1~2 hour activity that I would recommend to both adults and kids who like planes or are interested in learning about commercial aviation history. We were lucky enough to visit during their special Lego exhibition, and got to see Lego replicas of planes and destinations around the world.

\## The museum itself is located within the American Airlines Flight Academy campus within Dallas-Forth Worth Airport. Apparently it was established in 1993, but you wouldn’t be able to tell. It was modern, clean and well kept. Per my experience, it’s way nicer than the Frontier Flight Museum up in Dallas Love Field.

As with all aviation museums, there is a model cock-pit that you can sit in. My 2 y/o was too scared to sit in it, so Mommy went in there and gave it a spin. 

The special Lego exhibit was a nice addition. We got to see Mount Fuji, New York, Rio de Janeiro. 

A globe.

The best part of the museum was the playground. TY loved it and spent the bulk of the trip going down this slide.

They also had a game where you could organize the luggage. As parents of two boys, that was a hard pass. We do enough of that on the regular.

The engines were also pretty cool to see. This one was GE made.

\## The second highlight was definitely this plane that they had indoors. They had it open so you could go inside. It was a dark and a bit stinky inside (prompting TY to say “oooh poopoo”). No real wow-factors inside but the outside is SHINY. 

\## Lastly we spent some time flying the planes. Unfortunately there weren’t enough instructions for us and we all crash landed. Better luck next time.

Lisbon is a photographer's dream because the light bounces off tile-covered buildings like a mirror ball. I carried one camera, one lens, and made peace with wandering uphill repeatedly. This travelogue shares my walking map, favorite miradouros, and the presets I used to edit warm tones without losing the shadowy cobblestones.
